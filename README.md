SMS Spam Detection Model based on Natural Language Processing and Naive Bayes Classifier.


Natural language processing is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and 
artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human languages, 
in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

In machine learning, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" 
based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.

Based on that this model clean the natural message given as data set to it then using the 
sklearn NLP library we clean the words and remove grammers and keep the key words 
then we train our model based on probalistic algorithm i.e. Naive Bayes Classifier 
and based on that we test our trained model.
